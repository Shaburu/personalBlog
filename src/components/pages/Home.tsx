          I am applying as a GSoC student this year.I am writing this blog when the GSoC student application period is about to begin. 
          This blog will cover the journey of applying for the GSoc organization and the challenges I faced during it and how I tackled them. 
          I see myself as a problem solver rather than a programmer. Im not constrained to any Language.

          <h3>
          Computer Vision and Machine Learning to build an Advanced Mushroom Habitat  
          </h3>
          The primary objective of this research is to uncover the optimal growth conditions for various mushroom species. Through a meticulous process of cultivating mushrooms on agar plates, we aim to identify the specific temperature, humidity, light, and nutrient levels that promote their robust development. By meticulously documenting each growth stage and comparing the effects of varying factors, we hope to refine cultivation techniques for both culinary and medicinal mushroom varieties.

          I've created several Filters some that let's you track a 3D object 
        onto a plane in AR, some that take the runtime of the application and make a little game
        One such is a cat filter that was accepted by Instagram and has over 13Million impressions

          <h3>OPEN-SOURCED, PLEASE CONTRIBUTE</h3>
          A platform for enthusiasts, hobbyists, and researchers to cultivate mushrooms with precision and efficiency.
          We're designing a state-of-the-art chamber that leverages cutting-edge technology to provide the optimal environment for mushroom growth. 
          And here's the exciting part: it's open-source. This means that every step of our design, every bit of our code, will be freely available to all. 
          Together, we can make mushroom cultivation accessible to anyone with a passion for fungi.
          Democratizing mushroom cultivation. Your contributions will help refine the design, 
          improve the technology, and ensure that this invaluable knowledge reaches everyone who's eager to learn.
